# React.js Jobs Dashboard App

This is a fork of [John Smilga's job app](https://github.com/john-smilga/react-jobs-app/), modified to work with my custom backend APIs built in [ts-express-jobs-api](https://github.com/AdhamElRouby/ts-express-jobs-api/). The app functions as a job management system, allowing users to log in, create job entries, update existing ones, and delete them.
